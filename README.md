BookBot is my first project!
Now that I have finished the bookbot and have had a chance to look at the submitted solutions on book.dev, I realize my method for creating the dictionay of number of times each character appearing in the book was very inffecient. It has to read through the whole book 26 times to make the list. The provided solution of just reading through the book once and adding each new character to a dictionary is much better. I also didn't make nearly enough of my code generalized for easy use later (not saving book path as a variable etc..)
